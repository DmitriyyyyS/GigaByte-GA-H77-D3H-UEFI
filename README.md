# GigaByte-GA-H77-D3H-UEFI
Efi build under Hackintosh, 
Here is the full configuration on which this EFI runs
CPU - Intel Core i5-3450
GigaByte GA-H77-D3H UEFI
SAPPHIRE PULSE Radeon RX 560 2GB
It was tested on versions 10.14.6 and 10.15.3 Gave an excellent result
I managed to get everything started, and sound and video and intel acceleration,
if you use the same motherboard but a different video card, then this efi can also work, 
or another processor will also work on ivy bridge.
It is important to enable AHCI in BIOS settings, if there is a discrete graphics,
you must specify the priority of the video output "PEG" and Intel graphics also enable for acceleration,
also set DVMT INTEL 32mb
I will update the clover version if possible
